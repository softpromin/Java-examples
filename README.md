[span class="red"]Initial draft; not working yet[/span]

## Get the Examples ##

[Click here](https://github.com/BruceEckel/TIJ4-Refreshed-Examples/archive/master.zip) to download the zip file. Unzip the file into a directory of your choice.

## Build the Examples ##
Install the latest version of Java 8 (JDK8).

Install Apache Ant. Follow the instructions [here](https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html#getting).

Start a command prompt in the directory where you installed the examples. If your installation is successful, you should be able to type **ant** and build everything. You may initially get some error messages telling you to install additional packages, but eventually you should get through the whole build process successfully.
